**Title:** Dots and Boxes

**Target Platform:** Desktop

**Game Genre:** Strategy/Puzzle


**Game Objective**

The primary goal of Dots and Boxes is to score more points than your opponent by strategically connecting dots to form boxes on a grid. The player must claim as many boxes as possible while preventing their opponent from doing the same.


**Rules of the Game**

1. The game is played on a grid of dots, with each player taking turns to connect two adjacent dots with a line.
2. When a player completes the fourth side of a square (box) by drawing the final line, they claim that box and gets another turn.
3. Players earn one point for each box they claim.
4. The game continues until all possible lines have been drawn on the grid.
5. The player with the most boxes at the end of the game wins. If both players have the same number of boxes, the game results in a tie.


**Game Mechanics**

- Players take turns connecting two adjacent dots by drawing lines horizontally or vertically.
- The game displays the grid of dots, and players can click to draw lines.
- As players claim boxes, the boxes change color to indicate ownership.
- The game keeps track of the score for each player and announces the winner at the end of the game.
